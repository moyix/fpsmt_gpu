* Fix up the rounding modes in NativeFloat.cu
    - Mostly done
    - Still need to figure out the nearest int routines
* LOL what are unit tests
* Make it easier to run different SMT formulas
    - John has this in his branch, just need to integrate
* Figure out how to count executions / second
* Performance measurement & optimization

DONE:
* Find a harder SMT formula
    - Done
* Generalize to more variables
    - Done!
* Support multiple GPUs
    - Done!
